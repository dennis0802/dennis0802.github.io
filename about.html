            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi there, I'm Dennis Dao. I will be graduating from the University of Windsor this June with a Bachelor of Computer Science degree and love creating things
                people find cool or useful!
                <br/><br/>
                Since first using technology as a kid, I've had a fascination with what technology can do, leading me to pursue a degree in
                Computer Science, where I've picked up programming, algorithms, AI, and web development, and game development.
                <br/><br/>
                During my academics, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects for
                companies during co-op terms, school, and personal use. I have also worked as a 
                teaching assistant for various computer science courses, ranging from intro to programming to compiler theory.
                These experiences have provided opportunites to network with others and to 
                hone my technical skills and my problem-solving skills.
                <br/><br/>
                Looking ahead, I am excited to continue learning in computer science and technology as the technology advances. My goal is to
                make a meaningful impact to the people I work with, using my skills to build solutions to positively impact their lives.
                <br/><br/>
                Outside of computer science, I enjoy drawing, painting, gaming, watching TV shows, and photography.
